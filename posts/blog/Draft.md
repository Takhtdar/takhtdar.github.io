# Task, Scheduling, and Bar

we all have things to do. reading this blog for start is a thing that you decided to do. unlike many other tasks you have to do, paying attention to the following message isn't in your schedule. but if you want to plan for reading this later, there are at least two questions you needed to answer. (a) on what date do you want to schedule this task for, (b) how do you know that date isn't fully occupied with a bunch of other tasks?

In past few weeks that I have been practicing scheduling my tasks in obsidian, I came across the second problem. **how I know a day in coming week has free space for a task to be pushed in**. there is a great list of plugins out there developed by greater community of Obsidian who deserve a shoutout. I wanted something in my dashboard. and then in every daily note I make. something fit.

Tasks don't fall from sky! Tasks have context, they come from decisions we (or our surrendering/environment) make every day, life we choice to experience, people who we talk and  books that we decide to read. if you don't plant a tree today, you don't have a task of watering it some day in future. I write my tasks in my daily notes along with a few paragraph, how I come across this task? what chain of decision have been followed to meet this task? I write the paragraph not only for my future self but also for AI, so one day (let's say a year and 26 weeks) along with motivation I get after reading the task, AI might be able to bring that task and tell me it can help me with. or do it by itself! if task is explained well by surrendering notes why there be a problem with being ambition to actually add as many task as you dream of?

I don't like the idea of switching the window from my daily note to another window just to see if there is some free space in a near by date to be occupied by the coming task. problem was when I added a task I had two choice doing it today, or tomorrow. I didn't know what I am planning for three days from now, not without looking at this huge digital calendar screen.

to solve my task scheduling problem in obsidian without having a huge screen like any existing calendar, I came up with a simple yet effective way to see my scheduled list after tomorrow. I called it the bar, you can call it whatever you like as long as you actually use it. it's a bar (such a surprise) that have been divided to seven part by default, each part represent a day except for first one which represent today and tasks for earlier days, tasks that are overdue. depending on how many tasks you have allocated for a certain date the color of each part (day/date) change. the Bar has three levels/stacks, the first levels (the top bar) shows time allocation based on numerical emojis 1Ô∏è‚É£, 2Ô∏è‚É£, 3Ô∏è‚É£, ..., second shows mental and cognitive energy by looking for circle emoji based on their color üü¢, üü°, üü†, üî¥ and last stack is for showing days that have urgent task based on their priority üîº ‚è´.

by no mean this script is completed, and scientifically and research based proven. it's just a toy I use to pick a date for my next task in a glance.
